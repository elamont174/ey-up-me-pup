### Colour Scheme
An image of dogs was used as the central image due to the main theme of the website being about dogs. Leonardo AI was used to generate a beautiful 'painting' - this was then run through a colour picker to generate a colour palette. This colour palette was used throughtout the website to complement this central image.

- Tan (#cead87) and cape-cod (#3a4b46) were used as high contrast colours in the header and footer. High contrast is important for easy reading for the user, providing a positive user experience. It is also for this reason that cocoa-brown (#292220) and leather (#926d4c) were used together as the main background colour.
