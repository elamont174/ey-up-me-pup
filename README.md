# Ey Up Me Pup!

## Project Aims

#### A note on the name
"Ey Up Me Duck" is a commonly used phrase in the East Midlands (including Nottingham). It is a term of endearment which essentially means "hello my dear". 'Ey Up Me Pup!' is a play on words on this popular phrase. 

## User experience
### Purpose
- Ey Up Me Pup! is designed for dog owners in Nottingham. The 'Pup Team' write reviews on various pubs, cafes and other locations based on how dog friendly they are - users can then write their own reviews on these locations. 

### Target audience
- The target audience of Ey Up Me Pup would be locals and tourists with dogs.

## Design
### Wireframes

### Colour Scheme
-An image of dogs was used as the central image due to the main theme of the website being about dogs. Leonardo AI was used to generate a beautiful 'painting' - this was then run through a colour picker to generate a colour palette. This colour palette was used throughtout the website to complement this central image.

#### Colour palette
- ![Colour palette](static/images/palette.png)
- tan: #cead87
- cocoa-brown: #292220
- leather: #926d4c
- irish-coffee: #613a29
- willow-grove: #646e5c
- donkey-brown: #a69e72
- copper: #bd8130
- cape-cod: #3a4b46
- regent-gray: #8392a5
- san-juan: #38526d

- Tan (#cead87) and cape-cod (#3a4b46) were used as high contrast colours in the header and footer. High contrast is important for easy reading for the user, providing a positive user experience. It is also for this reason that cocoa-brown (#292220) and leather (#926d4c) were used together as the main background colour.

### Typography
- Google fonts were used to source the font styles.
- Sans-serif is considered the best type of font to read for those who have dyslexia or autism so only sans-serif type fonts were chosen.
- Since the website is for dog owners, and contributed to by dog owners, a handwritten style of font was used for the title to signify that this is a more casual, user-friendly website. The "Shantell Sans" was chosen for it's playful feel.

- For the content of the website, "Alegreya Sans" was chosen as a cleaner font which is easier to read, while still being slightly softer on the eye.
